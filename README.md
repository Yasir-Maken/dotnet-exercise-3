# C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice! 🤖📚
Hey there! 👋 This repo is my personal playground for diving deep into the awesome world of C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Think of it as my little workshop where I'm building and experimenting with C# concepts.

I'm tackling common OOP challenges, and each task helps me get a better grip on how C# objects work their magic! ✨

## What's Inside?
So far, I've been working on these exciting tasks:

### Task 1: The Anatomy of a Class 📖

Here, I built a Book class from scratch! I learned all about private member variables (like _title, _author), how to make constructors (both default and custom) to create new book objects, and how to add methods to display book info. It's like creating a blueprint for every book in a digital library!

### Task 2: All About Static 💡

This task was all about static members. I created a TemperatureConverter utility class with static methods (like CelsiusToFahrenheit and FahrenheitToCelsius). The cool part? You don't need to create an object of this class to use its methods – you just call them directly! Super handy for universal tools. 🌡️

### Task 3: Method Parameters & TryParse Challenge ✅

This one focused on flexible method parameters, especially the out keyword. I implemented a TryParseInteger method, which is super useful for safely converting a string into a number. It returns true or false to tell you if the conversion worked, and gives you the number if it did! No more crashes from bad input! 🛡️
